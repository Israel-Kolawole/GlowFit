**ABOUT THIS BOOK**

This book features detailed worked examples of Python code for the analysis and modeling of
luminescence signals. Users can run immediately the Python
codes, and modify them for their experimental data and to explore the 
various luminescence models. The theory and equations behind each subject are
 summarized, and appropriate references are given from the literature,
so that researchers can look up the details of the theory and the relevant
experiments. 
   The book and the Python scripts contain comments explaining the structure
and the various parts of the code. Researchers can use the Python codes to
analyze their own experimental data, and to extract the various parameters
describing mathematically the luminescence signals.

**HOW THE USE THE PYTHON CODES**

The book contains 99 Python scripts, which are self contained and ready to run,  and 
represent new codes written by the author. 
The codes are organized in folders by chapter in this repository.

The book assumes some basic knowledge of Python, however I believe
that it will be useful for both newcomers to Python, as well as to experienced
programmers who wish to learn more about the various luminescence phe-
nomena. 

Experienced programmers will certainly find out that they can improve
the Python codes given here, and it is of course possible to make the codes
more compact and elegant. However, I chose to provide Python codes which
are simple and clear, and which can be easily modified for the purposes of
the reader, rather than attempting to create compact codes which may be
diffcult to follow. I have kept the number of required external Python pack-
ages intentionally at a minimum, so that newcomers can follow the Python
codes easily. All figures in this book were produced using the Python codes
in the book, so that users know immediately what to expect when they run
the codes. Additional drawings for the various luminescence models in the
book were drawn using Inkscape, and the book was produced overall using
LyX.

The presented codes and models fall within two broad categories, based
on delocalized and localized transitions. In delocalized transition models the
conduction and/or valence band participate in the luminescence process. By
contrast, in the localized type of models the luminescence process does not
involve the energy bands, but rather takes place between the ground an/or
excited state of the trapped electron/hole, and an energy level of the recom-
bination center.

This document introduces general examples of experimental lumines-
cence data, and discusses the various experimental techniques for measuring
the luminescence signals. These signals include thermoluminescence (TL),
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), infrared stimulated luminescence
(IRSL), as well as the commonly used experimental modes of continuous
wave (CW-OSL or CW-IRSL), linearly modulated (LM-OSL or LM-IRSL),
constant heating rate TL, isothermal TL (ITL) and time-resolved (TR). Two chapters are
dedicated to the analysis of the dose response of luminescence materials.

I hope you will find the scripts useful and that you will enjoy running and modifying the various files.
